This is my implementation of TOP web dev 101 HTML/CSS project (EASY).

In this project, I was created a replica of the google.com standard
homepage using skills and techniques such as:
CSS3 flexbox
Chrome DevTools etc.

NOTE: The commit messages with "revert to a previous state" was when
I tried to place the images and css files into respective folders for
better organization but ran into a bug with the search icon refusing to
display.
